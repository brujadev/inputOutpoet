This is story time. This is in the tradition of care. Of taking time to comb through the kinks of complexity and breaking things down for people who would otherwise remain lost. Learning about this place that exists within your computer and how it communicates
can give you the gift of time. It will allow you to sort through, swift, cleanse, nourish, and enhance: Your projects Your files. It will reorient you to you to your things a thing, you value a lot that connects you, to you and the world. The Termimal.
The Command Line. I love thinking about this place within my laptop as a water well. When we access it, it provides us with so much. Let me explain further: Imagine your laptop as a home: When you first purchased your laptop, remember how you created
an account with your name on it and then a little house appeared next to it. Yeah, that’s it! You entered your home, let’s say the living room: desktop. Your bedroom: documents folder. If you happen to have a closet or a bathroom in your bedroom, these
are sub folders within the Documents folder. Let’s say the kitchen: applications folder. You get my drift? There are a number of places that hold things we value and in need in our home, the same as our laptop. Now that we know our home, the terminal
is another a way to access different parts to the home, without using the mouse as a navigation tool. In your home, you’d just walk to each different room. You’re in your bedroom and think, “hmm I’m hungry. I want a snack.” So you get up and walk to the
kitchen. On your computer you can use your mouse, go to the finder window and click Applications. The terminal: let's you type different words and letters, known as commands, to do the walking or the mouse moving for you. “bash commands” {Bash is the
language Mac computers speak in. They don’t understand: “hey show me where I am." They need you to type in the terminal program, } type: PWD which stands for “print working directory.” Then you’re like, “cool, I am in my living room and now, I want to
go to the kitchen.” In order to move from your Home to your Documents, you would type “cd Documents.” So to summarize, you can go from this idea of a “front-end user” to a “back end programmer”. What this means is that when using the terminal, you are
developing a much more intimate and familiar relationship with your computer. Because you speak it’s language, you can move through your files quicker using the command line. Now using the terminal not only allows you to move through files in your computer,
you can make new files and folders, too. You can see what’s in a folder, you can remove a folder or a file. You can install other software programs and so much more. —————————————————————— Reference Projects: Maya Man
