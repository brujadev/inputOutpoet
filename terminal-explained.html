    First thing’s first: this ain’t a tutorial. This is story time.<br>This is in the tradition of care. Of taking time to comb through the kinks of complexity and breaking things down for people who would otherwise remain lost.<br>Learning this piece
    of software and how it communicates can give you time. It will allow you to sort through, swift, cleanse, nourish, and enhance: Your projects Your files And honestly your overall relationship to your laptop You ever sat next to someone typing their
    life away and their screen and it looks black with green letters. Or white screens with black letters, like in the text editor. And you have no idea what all those lines meant? Maybe they were in this oasis called the terminal. Often referred to as
    the command line. I love thinking about this place in my laptop as a water well because when we access it, it provides us with so much. Let me explain further: Imagine your laptop as a home. When you first purchased your laptop, remember how you created
    an account with your name on it and then. Little house appeared next to it. Yeah, that’s it! When you enter your home, let’s say the living room is actually the desktop. Your bedroom is the documents folder. If you happen to have a closet or a bathroom
    in your bedroom, these are sub folders within the Documents folder. Let’s say the kitchen is your Applications folder. It houses all the programs that allow you to do all sorts of things. You get my drift? There are a number of places that hold things
    we value and in need in our home, the same as our laptop. Okay and now that you get this concept of your laptop as your home and the terminal as a way to access different parts to your home, aka your laptop, let’s talk about how this happens. In your
    home, you’d just walk to each different room. For example, you’re in your bedroom and think, “hmm I’m hungry. I want a snack.” So you get up and walk to the kitchen. When you are on your computer you can just use your mouse, go to the finder window
    and click which part of your computer you want to open. Where as with the terminal, you can type different words and letters, known as commands, to do the walking or the mouse moving for you. The commands used are what’s called “bash commands.” Bash
    is the language Mac computers speak in. They don’t understand: “hey show me where I am” They need you to type in the terminal program, PWD which stands for “print working directory.” Then you’re like, “cool I am in my living room and now, I want to
    go to the kitchen.” In order to move from your Home to your Documents, you would type “cd Documents.” So to summarize, you can go from this idea of a “front-end user” to a “back end programmer”. What this means is that when using the terminal, you
    are developing a much more intimate and familiar relationship with your computer. Because you speak it’s language, you can move through your files quicker using the command line. Now using the terminal not only allows you to move through files in
    your computer, you can make new files and folders, too. You can see what’s in a folder, you can remove a folder or a file. You can install other software programs and so much more.
